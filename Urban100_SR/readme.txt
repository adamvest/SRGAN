Super-resolution results on the Urban 100 dataset (100 test images)

- The Flickr links to the 100 images

=== HR === 
- High-resolution images. All images were cropped so that each dimension is a multiplication of the super-resolution factor.
This avoids the misalignment problem in the quantitative comparison.

=== LR === 
- Low-resolution test image
- Generated with bicubic kernel with downsampling

=== bicubic === 
- Bicubic interpolation

=== nearest ===  
- nearest interpolation
